Kraftvaerk, currently using an Angular-based site, wanted to make the shift to React.js. Our specific role was to kickstart this transition by focusing on the basics, particularly building the SST (presumably Single Page Application) page. This project gave us the opportunity to explore the ins and outs of React.js and play a role in the early phases of Kraftvaerk's migration to a new technology. As a contributor, my responsibility was to create the SST Execute page and establish the fundamental routes, laying the foundation for the broader migration effort."
